                Bio: My Name is Leighana Glover and I am from Brooklyn, New York <br> but I currently reside in Queens, New York.
                I am currently a Computer Science <br>Major and classified as a junior. I am a bit of a tomboy because I was the
                <br> youngest girl in my family for 10+ years, so natuarally I picked up habits
                <br> of the boys around me. I hope to pursue a career in software engineering, 
                <br>possibly in front-end engineering because it has always been an <br>interest of mine.
                I enjoy doing skincare, haircare, and <br>recently took interest in working out.
